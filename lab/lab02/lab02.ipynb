    "One important type of expression is the **call expression**. A call expression begins with the name of a function and is followed by the argument(s) of that function in parentheses. The function returns some value, based on its arguments. Some important mathematical functions are listed below.\n",

For example, if we called `farmers_markets_locations.sort(\"x\")`, then running `farmers_markets_locations` by itself would still return the unsorted table.\n",
    "4. Rows always stick together when a table is sorted.  It wouldn't make sense to sort just one column and leave the other columns alone.  For example, in this case, if we sorted just the `x` column, the farmers' markets would all end up with the wrong longitudes.\n",
